# How Prometheus Works
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics from configured targets at specified intervals. 
It stores these metrics as time-series data, allowing you to query and visualize them using PromQL



# What is the Prometheus query you can use in Granfana to properly show usage trend of an application metric that is a counter?
